<h3 align="center">Who I am?</h3>
<p align="left">
My name is Martin and I am from peaceful village in Slovakia.
I'm currently a student at Secondary vocational school of information technologies.

I really do like PHP with combination of SQL and that's also why I'm working in these two daily.
However, I also know and like Python, JavaScript, bit of TypeScript and Node.js.

I can speak Slovak.. obviously, as well as Czech, but I do know English in way you can speak with me and understand me, though it's true I am better in typing in English rather then in communication, but it's not a big deal.
I am also trying to learn German as well.
